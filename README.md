# Hello-World
This is my first repository on Github

I learned to code in java and then went to learn Python.
Currently working as a Software Engineer Intern.

Goals:
  1. be able to write simple efficient code in both Python and Java.
  2. re-learn data structures concepts and apply them in both Python and Java.
  3. Expand my knowledge and skills in coding.
  4. Build Apps!
